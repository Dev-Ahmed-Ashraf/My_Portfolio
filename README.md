**Project Structure**

```
src/
  components/        Reusable UI blocks (Header, Hero, etc.)
  data/              Centralized content (projects, skills, timeline)
  hooks/             Custom hooks like useTheme
  pages/             Page-level layout (Home)
  styles/            Tailwind + CSS variables
  utils/             Helpers (theme + EmailJS)
public/
  assets/        # Profile, resume, project images
```

Inline comments mark the exact places to customize your name, bio, projects, resume link, and social handles.

🚀 Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173`.

🔐 Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` based on `.env.example`:

```
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_key
VITE_EMAILJS_TO_EMAIL=your_email
```

Get the values from your [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) dashboard. Without them the form throws an inline error.

### Tests

```
npm test
```

Jest + React Testing Library ships with an example Header test (`src/components/__tests__/Header.test.tsx`). Add more as you grow the site.

## Assets

| Asset                  | Path to drop in repo                           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Profile image          | `public/assets/profile.jpg`                    |
| Resume PDF             | `public/assets/resume.pdf`                     |
| Project visuals (PNGs) | `public/assets/projects/*.png` (already added) |
| OG Image               | `public/assets/og-image.png` (1200x630px)      |

### Asset Replacement Instructions

**To replace the profile image and resume:**

1. Locate your source files:

   - Profile image: `/mnt/data/9184332b-130d-48f3-813d-d0da930bc874.jpg`
   - Resume PDF: `/mnt/data/My_CV (9).pdf`

2. Copy them to the project, maintaining exact filenames:

   ```bash
   # Copy profile image
   cp "/mnt/data/9184332b-130d-48f3-813d-d0da930bc874.jpg" "public/assets/profile.jpg"

   # Copy resume
   cp "/mnt/data/My_CV (9).pdf" "public/assets/resume.pdf"
   ```

3. **Important:** Keep the filenames as `profile.jpg` and `resume.pdf` so existing code references work correctly.

**OG Image:**

- The OpenGraph image (`public/assets/og-image.png`) is already present and configured
- It's set to 1200x630px (OpenGraph standard) and matches the hero's neon blue (#2DA3FF) and purple (#8B5CF6) color theme
- Includes name and ".NET Backend Developer" subtitle
- If you want to regenerate it, ensure it maintains the same dimensions and color scheme for consistency

🌐 Deployment (Vercel)

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Create a new Vercel project and import the repository.
3. Set the EmailJS env vars under **Settings → Environment Variables**.
4. Build command: `npm run build`, Output: `dist`.
5. Trigger a deployment — Vercel serves the optimized SPA globally.

- Customization Checklist

- `src/components/Hero.tsx`: update `heroName`, subtitle badge, tagline, CTA copy.
- `src/components/Header.tsx` & `Footer.tsx`: replace the displayed name and nav labels if needed.
- `src/data/projects.ts`: fill in real case studies (titles, descriptions, tech, live/GitHub links, asset paths).
- `src/data/skills.ts`: tune levels + project mappings.
- `src/data/timeline.ts`: swap for your actual experience history.
- `src/components/ContactForm.tsx`: plug real social URLs + email.
- `public/assets/resume.pdf`: drop your CV generated from `/mnt/data/My_CV (9).pdf`.

♿ Accessibility & Performance

- Semantic HTML (header/main/section/footer)
- Focus-visible outlines + Skip navigation
- Reduced-motion support
- Lazy-load for images
- Minified assets & optimized bundle size

🏆 Why This Portfolio Stands Out

- Designed specifically with Backend Developer hiring in mind
